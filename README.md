# react-blog-redo

## Description

This is intended to be a generic blog where users can post, edit, delete, and comment. The application has been built using React, React Router, MongoDB, GraphQL, Express, Node, Apollo, JavaScript, and CSS.  This is my first full stack MERN app built completely on my own outside of a team setting.

### Current Work Update:

As of 3/2/22 I am debugging the build. "npm run start" and "npm run seed" are functioning properly, however "npm run build" returns a React Build Scripts error regarding babel-jest.  I believe there is an issue with my file structure and .gitignore regarding node modules and package-lock.json.  I would happily receive any insights on correcting this error as I move forward.
